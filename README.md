## Introduction

D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library used to create dynamic and interactive visualizations in the web browser. By manipulating the DOM and applying data transformations, D3.js enables you to turn raw data into stunning visuals.

## Setup

To start with D3.js, you'll need:

1. **A basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML.**
2. **A code editor** such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
3. **A local server** (e.g., Python's HTTP server or VS Code's Live Server extension).

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Include D3.js in your project:**
   ```html
   <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Create an HTML file for your visualizations:**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>D3.js Exercises</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Link your JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) where your D3.js code will go.**
